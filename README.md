# Psychic-Game
This is my first JavaScript application.

# Problem
Make a game so user has to guess what letter the computer has picked.

# Solution
Made an array of all letters and a random number generator for the computer's letter. Made an onkey function for user guess. Made if statements for correct and incorrect guesses.

# Tech
- Arrays
- document.onkeyup
- math.random
- if statements
- push

# Instructions
Try to guess which letter the computer is thinking of. Guess correctly and you get a win. Choose carefully since you only have 9 available guesses. Run out of guesses and you get a loss. Good Luck!

# Getting Started
If you want to edit this code. Just open any of the files and copy and paste the code into any coding program of your choice or perform a git pull.

# Prequisites
Just make sure you have a current updated browser.
